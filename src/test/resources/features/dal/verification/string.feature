Feature: string

  Scenario Outline: compare string
    Then the following verification should pass:
    """
      'abc'<opt> 'abc'
    """
    And the following verification should failed:
    """
      'abc'<opt> 'efg'

    Examples:
      | opt |
      | =   |
      | :   |

  Scenario: different string with =

    Expecting java.lang.String
