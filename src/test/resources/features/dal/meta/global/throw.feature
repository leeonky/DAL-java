Feature: meta ::throw

  Scenario: return exception
    Given the following java class:
    """
    public class Data {
      public void test() {
        throw new java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException();
      }
    }
    """
    Then the following verification for the instance of java class "Data" should pass:
    """
      test::throw.class.simpleName=  IndexOutOfBoundsException
    """

  Scenario: raise error when no throw in meta throw
    Given the following java class:
    """
    public class Data {
      public void test() {
      }
    }
    """
    When use a instance of java class "Data" to evaluate:
    """
      test::throw: {...}
    """
    Then failed with the message:
    """
    Expecting an error to be thrown, but nothing was thrown
    """
    And got the following notation:
    """
      test::throw: {...}
            ^
    """

  Scenario: should not catch throw when got java reflection exception
    Given the following java class:
    """
    public class Data {
      private void test() {
      }
    }
    """
    When use a instance of java class "Data" to evaluate:
    """
    test::throw: {...}
    """
    Then failed with the message:
    """
    Get property `test` failed, property can be:
      1. public field
      2. public getter
      3. public no args method
      4. Map key value
      5. customized type getter
      6. static method extension
    Method or property `test` does not exist in `#package#Data`
    """
    And got the following notation:
    """
    test::throw: {...}
    ^
    """

  Scenario: return exception from meta properties
    Given the following java class:
    """
    public class Data {
    }
    """
    And register DAL:
    """
    dal.getRuntimeContextBuilder().registerMetaProperty(Data.class, "error", meta-> {
      throw new java.lang.RuntimeException("error");
    });
    """
    Then the following verification for the instance of java class "Data" should pass:
    """
    ::error::throw: {
      class.simpleName=  RuntimeException
      message= error
    }
    """
